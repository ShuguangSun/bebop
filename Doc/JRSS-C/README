
The manuscript was submitted to a special edition of JRSS-C on early phase
trial methodology. The paper was rejected. The critical piece of feedback was
that the method was not novel, but a sub-case of a general design published by
Thall, Nguyen and Estey in 2008. The reviewer also disliked the absence of any
possibility for heterogeneity in the toxicity model (i.e. the 411 model was 
proposed). This feedback is frustrating in a way because clinical evidence exists
to support the assumption that toxicity does not vary across cohorts. Parameters
must be paid for in sample size, and adding parameters that probably add nothing
is detrmental to power. However, the reviewer probably thought that this cost
should at least be illustrated.
