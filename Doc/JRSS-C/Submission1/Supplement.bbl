    Traditional phase I studies find the therapeutic dose of an investigational
  drug based solely on toxicity and without regard to the drug's efficacy. We
  propose extending the continual reassessment method (CRM) to a bivariate
  trial design in which the maximum tolerated dose is based jointly on both
  toxicity and disease progression. We call our study design bCRM, for
  bivariate CRM, which we apply to a study of bone marrow patients seeking to
  find the optimal time after bone marrow transplant at which to taper immune
  suppression and eventually begin donor leukocyte infusions. We demonstrate
  through simulation that bCRM has excellent operating characteristics and
  compare the performance of bCRM in a bone marrow transplantation study to
  designs proposed by previous investigators. We also attempt to provide some
  direction to future investigators with regard to plausible models and
  distributions to use with a bivariate study design. {\textcopyright} 2002

    This paper looks at a new approach to the design and analysis of Phase 1
  clinical trials in cancer. The basic idea and motivation behind the approach
  stem from an attempt to reconcile the needs of dose-finding experimentation
  with the ethical demands of established medical practice. It is argued that
  for these trials the particular shape of the dose toxicity curve is of little
  interest. Attention focuses rather on identifying a dose with a given
  targeted toxicity level and on concentrating experimentation at that which
  all current available evidence indicates to be the best estimate of this
  level. Such an approach not only makes an explicit attempt to meet ethical
  requirements but also enables the use of models whose only requirements are
  that locally (i.e., around the dose corresponding to the targeted toxicity
  level) they reasonably well approximate the true probability of toxic
  response. Although a large number of models could be contemplated, we look at
  a particularly simple one. Extensive simulations show the model to have real
  promise.%

    For some drugs, toxicity events lead to early termination of treatment
  before a therapeutic response is observed. That is, there are three possible
  outcomes: toxicity (therapeutic response unknown), therapeutic response
  without toxicity, and no response with no toxicity. The optimal dose is the
  dose that maximizes the probability of the joint event, response, and no
  toxicity. The optimal safe dose is the dose, from among the doses with
  toxicity rate less than the maximum tolerable level, that maximizes the
  probability of response and no toxicity. We present a new sequential design

    Novel therapies are challenging the standards of drug development. Agents
  with specific biologic targets and limited toxicity require novel designs to
  determine doses to be taken forward into larger studies. In this paper, we
  describe an approach that incorporates both toxicity and efficacy data into
  the estimation of the biologically optimal dose of an agent in a phase I
  trial. The approach is based on the flexible continuation-ratio model, and
  uses straightforward optimal dose selection criteria. Dose selection is based
  on all patients treated up until that time point, using a continual
  reassessment method approach. Dose-outcome curves considered include
  monotonically increasing, monotonically decreasing, and unimodal curves. Our
  simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed design, which we call
  TriCRM, has favourable operating characteristics.%

    Novel therapies are challenging the standards of drug development. Agents
  with specific biologic targets, unknown dose-efficacy curves, and limited
  toxicity mandate novel designs to identify biologically optimal doses. We
  review two model-based designs that utilize either a proportional odds model
  or a continuation ratio model to identify an optimal dose of a single or
  two-agent combination in a Phase I setting utilizing both toxicity and
  efficacy data. A continual reassessment method with straightforward dose
  selection criterion using accumulated data from all patients treated until
  that time point is employed while allowing for separate toxicity and efficacy
  curves for each drug in a two-drug setting. The simulation studies
  demonstrate considerable promise, at least theoretically, in the ability of
  such model-based designs to identify the optimal dose. Despite such favorable
  operating characteristics, there are several pragmatic challenges that hinder
  the routine implementation of such model-based designs in practice. We review
  and offer practical solutions to potentially overcome some of these
  challenges. The acceptance and integration of these designs in practice may
  be quicker and easier if they are developed in concert with a clinical
  paradigm.%

    We present a new adaptive Bayesian method for dose-finding in phase I
  clinical trials based on both response and toxicity. Although clinical
  responses are usually rare in phase I cancer trials, molecularly targeted
  therapy may make clinical responses more likely. In addition, biological
  responses may be common. Thus responses may be frequent enough to help decide
  how aggressive a phase I escalation should be. The model assumes that
  response and toxicity events happen depending on respective dose thresholds
  for the individual, assuming that the thresholds jointly follow a bivariate
  log-normal distribution or a mixture. The design utilizes prior information
  about the population threshold distribution as well as accumulated data. The
  next dose is assigned to maximize a patient-oriented expected utility
  integrated over the current posterior distribution. The design is evaluated
  through simulation with population parameters equaling estimates from early
  Gleevec trials. This exercise provides evidence for the value of the use of
  the proposed design for future clinical trials.%

    The purpose of this paper is to describe and illustrate an outcome-adaptive
  Bayesian procedure, proposed by Thall and Cook (2004), for assigning doses of
  an experimental treatment to successive cohorts of patients. The method uses
  elicited (efficacy, toxicity) probability pairs to construct a family of
  trade-off contours that are used to quantify the desirability of each dose.
  This provides a basis for determining a best dose for each cohort. The method
  combines the goals of conventional Phase I and Phase II trials, and thus may
  be called a "Phase I-II" design. We first give a general review of the
  probability model and dose-finding algorithm. We next describe an application
  to a trial of a biologic agent for treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia,
  including a computer simulation study to assess the design's average
  behavior. To illustrate how the method may work in practice, we present a
  cohort-by-cohort example of a particular trial. We close with a discussion of
  some practical issues that may arise during implementation.%

  interest, but co-primary endpoints are available to assess the toxic effects
  or the working of the compound. Modeling the responses jointly is thus
  appealing to draw overall inferences using all responses and to capture the
  association among the responses. Non-Gaussian outcomes are often modeled
  univariately using exponential family models. To accommodate both the
  overdispersion and hierarchical structure in the data, Molenberghs et al. A
  family of generalized linear models for repeated measures with normal and
  conjugate random effects. Statistical Science 2010; 25:325-347 proposed using
  two separate sets of random effects. This papers considers a model for
  multivariate data with hierarchically clustered and overdispersed
  non-Gaussian data. Gamma random effect for the over-dispersion and normal
  random effects for the clustering in the data are being used. The two
  outcomes are jointly analyzed by assuming that the normal random effects for
  both endpoints are correlated. The association structure between the response
  is analytically derived. The fit of the joint model to data from a so-called
  comet assay are compared with the univariate analysis of the two outcomes.

  general methods for handling bivariate response data are of interest. A
  procedure for sequentially analysing both efficacy and toxicity data is
  presented. The procedure is designed to allow early termination due to
  efficacy results, toxicity results, or both. The method is based on modified
  marginal sequential analyses, accounting for bivariate correlated responses

  normally distributed responses. Extensions to bivariate failure time data are
  indicated and an example from a kidney transplant study demonstrates the

    Phase II clinical trials in oncology are used to initially evaluate the
  therapeutic efficacy of a new treatment regimen. Simon's two-stage design is
  commonly used for such trials. However, he only focused on the "response
  rate", the proportion of patients experiencing tumor regression. In clinical
  practice, it is preferred of a sequential design to monitor antitumor
  activity as well as toxicity. Conaway and Petroni proposed a method for
  designing phase II trials on the basis of both treatment efficacy and safety,
  which imply an equal weighing of response and toxicity. In this paper, we
  developed an alternative test to cope with the trade-off between safety and
  efficacy. The main idea is to control for the marginal type I errors of
  response rate and toxicity rate separately. We provide guides on searching
  the stopping and rejecting regions and determination of sample size. The
  proposed method has advantage over other designs, including those of Conaway
  and Petroni's and Bryant and Day's, that it can definitely control one type I
  error of the interests such as treatment antitumor activity or safety and is
  robust against the real association parameter. Furthermore, it is conceptive
  intuitive, very simple to implement, and also feasible for the requirement of
  small sample size in a phase II trial. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights

    Tan and Machin (biStat. Med. 2002; 21:1991-2012) introduce a Bayesian
  two-stage design for phase II clinical trials where the binary endpoint of
  interest is treatment efficacy. In this paper we propose an extension of
  their design to incorporate safety considerations. At each stage we define
  the treatment successful and deserving of further study if the total number
  of adverse events is sufficiently small and the number of responders who
  simultaneously do not experience any toxicity is sufficiently large.
  Therefore, our criterion is based on the joint posterior probability that the
  true overall toxicity rate and the true efficacy-and-safety rate are,
  respectively, smaller and larger than conveniently pre-specified target
  values. The optimal two-stage sample sizes are determined specifying a
  minimum threshold for the above-mentioned posterior probability, computed
  under the assumption that favorable outcomes have occurred. Besides
  describing the proposed design, we suggest how to construct informative prior
  scenarios and we also apply the reference algorithm to derive a
  non-informative prior distribution. Finally, some numerical results are
  provided and a real data application is illustrated.%

    We consider the outcomes of a clinical trial as determined by one, or
  several, possibly hidden causes. This paper proposes a statistical model that
  allows such a distinction of causes not only for the main, or therapeutic,
  effects but also for the side, or toxic, effects. More specifically, we focus
  on trials where the effects are naturally dichotomized, that is, where the
  health of a patient has improved or not, and where a specific adverse effect
  has occurred or not. A case study provides an example of the way this model
  can help to solve some problems of suspected drug toxicity. Finally, the
  model is shown to be a part of a hierarchy of models and the way to select a
  best model is investigated.%

    PURPOSE: Efficacy and toxicity are both important outcomes in cancer
  clinical trials. Nonetheless, most statistical designs for phase II trials
  only provide rules for evaluating treatment efficacy, and moreover only allow
  early stopping after fixed cohorts of patients have been treated. We
  illustrate a new statistical design strategy for monitoring both adverse and
  efficacy outcomes on a patient-by-patient basis in phase II and other
  single-arm clinical trials. DESIGN: The new strategy is used to design a
  phase II trial of the experimental regimen idarubicin plus cytarabine (ara-C)
  plus cyclosporine for treatment of patients with intermediate-prognosis acute
  myelogenous leukemia (AML). The design requires a maximum of 56 patients and
  provides continuous monitoring boundaries to terminate the trial if the
  toxicity rate is unacceptably high or the complete remission (CR) rate is
  unacceptably low compared with the rates of these events with the standard
  regimen of anthracycline plus ara-C. RESULTS: The design has an 88{\%} to
  91{\%} probability of stopping the trial early with a median of 15 to 18
  patients if the toxicity rate of the experimental regimen is .05 to .10 above
  that of the standard and there is no improvement in the CR rate. If there is
  a .15 improvement in the CR rate and the toxicity rate is no more than .05
  above that of the standard, then there is at least an 83{\%} probability that
  the trial will run to completion. CONCLUSION: The proposed monitoring
  strategy provides a flexible, practical means to continuously monitor both
  safety and efficacy in single-arm cancer clinical trials. The design strategy
  can be implemented easily using a freely available menu-driven computer
  program, and provides a scientifically sound alternative to the use of ad hoc
  safety monitoring rules%

    Clinical trials have revolutionized medicine by providing reliable evidence
  on the efficacy and safety of new treatments. Until recently, clini-cal
  trials were designed and analyzed under the assumption that the effects of
  treatment were broadly similar in different individuals, and hence the goal
  of the clinical trial was primar-ily to provide precise and unbiased
  estimates of these common effects. Today, the advent of molecular biology has
  modified the funda mental tenet that the effect of treatment varies only
  ran-domly from patient to patient. There are indeed increasing numbers of
  treatments (especially targeted agents) whose effects vary widely as a
  function of individual molecular characteristics. When these characteristics
  are known early on in the course of developing of new treatments, clinical
  trials can be designed to target only those patients who are expected to
  benefit. However, more commonly, the exact molecular character-istics that
  drive a patient's response to a specific treatment are unknown and might only
  be dis-covered during the clinical development of the treatment or indeed
  following its approval. This fact has profound implications for clinical
  trials; it may indeed revolutionize the way in which tri-als are planned and
  executed [1–3]. The purposes of this article are, first, to discuss the
  ways in which biomarkers (including, but not limited to, molecular
  characteristics) are validated in clini-cal trials, and second, to consider
  how they can be incorporated into clinical trial designs with the goal of
  optimizing the use of new therapies in biomarker-defined subgroups of
  patients. Our examples all come from the field of oncology, where efforts to
  develop new methodologies for clinical research have been most intense, but
  fur-ther examples abound in the other therapeutic areas [4]. We will focus
  our discussion on statisti-cal issues, leaving aside practical considerations
  related to the bio markers themselves, such as their accessibility in
  specific tissues (e.g., in fresh, frozen or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
  tis-sue) or the ease and reliability of their quantifica-tion (e.g., through
  reverse-transcriptase PCR or microarray), all of which greatly contribute to
  their potential for use in clinical practice.%

    Background Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against human epidermal
  growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; also known as ERBB2), was investigated in
  combination with chemotherapy for first-line treatment of HER2-positive
  advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer. Methods ToGA
  (Trastuzumab for Gastric Cancer) was an open-label, international, phase 3,
  randomised controlled trial undertaken in 122 centres in 24 countries.
  Patients with gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer were eligible for
  inclusion if their tumours showed overexpression of HER2 protein by
  immunohistochemistry or gene amplification by fluorescence in-situ
  hybridisation. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive
  a chemotherapy regimen consisting of capecitabine plus cisplatin or
  fluorouracil plus cisplatin given every 3 weeks for six cycles or
  chemotherapy in combination with intravenous trastuzumab. Allocation was by
  block randomisation stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
  performance status, chemotherapy regimen, extent of disease, primary cancer
  site, and measurability of disease, implemented with a central interactive
  voice recognition system. The primary endpoint was overall survival in all
  randomised patients who received study medication at least once. This trial
  is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01041404. Findings 594
  patients were randomly assigned to study treatment (trastuzumab plus
  chemotherapy, n=298; chemotherapy alone, n=296), of whom 584 were included in
  the primary analysis (n=294; n=290). Median follow-up was 18??6 months (IQR
  11-25) in the trastuzumab plus chemotherapy group and 17??1 months (9-25) in
  the chemotherapy alone group. Median overall survival was 13??8 months (95 CI
  12-16) in those assigned to trastuzumab plus chemotherapy compared with 11??1
  months (10-13) in those assigned to chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio 0??74;
  95 CI 0??60-0??91; p=0??0046). The most common adverse events in both groups
  were nausea (trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, 197 [67] vs chemotherapy alone,
  184 [63]), vomiting (147 [50] vs 134 [46]), and neutropenia (157 [53] vs 165
  [57]). Rates of overall grade 3 or 4 adverse events (201 [68] vs 198 [68])
  and cardiac adverse events (17 [6] vs 18 [6]) did not differ between groups.
  Interpretaion Trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy can be considered
  as a new standard option for patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric or
  gastro-oesophageal junction cancer. Funding F Hoffmann-La Roche. ?? 2010

    UNLABELLED: The Biomarker-integrated Approaches of Targeted Therapy for
  Lung Cancer Elimination (BATTLE) trial represents the first completed
  prospective, biopsy-mandated, biomarker-based, adaptively randomized study in
  255 pretreated lung cancer patients. Following an initial equal randomization
  period, chemorefractory non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients were
  adaptively randomized to erlotinib, vandetanib, erlotinib plus bexarotene, or
  sorafenib, based on relevant molecular biomarkers analyzed in fresh core
  needle biopsy specimens. Overall results include a 46{\%} 8-week disease

  an impressive benefit from sorafenib among mutant-KRAS patients. BATTLE
  establishes the feasibility of a new paradigm for a personalized approach to
  lung cancer clinical trials. SIGNIFICANCE: The BATTLE study is the first
  completed prospective, adaptively randomized study in heavily pretreated
  NSCLC patients that mandated tumor profiling with "real-time" biopsies,
  taking a substantial step toward realizing personalized lung cancer therapy
  by integrating real-time molecular laboratory findings in delineating
  specific patient populations for individualized treatment.%

    Clinical biomarker tests that aid in making treatment decisions will play
  an important role in achieving personalized medicine for cancer patients.
  Definitive evaluation of the clinical utility of these biomarkers requires
  conducting large randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Efficient RCT design is
  therefore crucial for timely introduction of these medical advances into
  clinical practice, and a variety of designs have been proposed for this
  purpose. To guide design and interpretation of RCTs evaluating biomarkers, we
  present an in-depth comparison of advantages and disadvantages of the
  commonly used designs. Key aspects of the discussion include efficiency
  comparisons and special interim monitoring issues that arise because of the
  complexity of these RCTs. Important ongoing and completed trials are used as
  examples. We conclude that, in most settings, randomized biomarker-stratified
  designs (ie, designs that use the biomarker to guide analysis but not
  treatment assignment) should be used to obtain a rigorous assessment of
  biomarker clinical utility.%

    Phase II study designs are proposed that evaluate both clinical response
  and toxicity, and that are similar in structure to Simon's two-stage designs.
  Sample sizes and decision criteria are chosen to minimize the maximum
  expected accrual, given that the treatment is unacceptable either in terms of
  clinical response or toxicity. This is achieved subject to control of error
  rates, either uniformly over all possible correlation structures linking
  response and toxicity, or alternatively, under an assumption of independence
  between response and toxicity. In the latter case, bounds on the error rates
  show that effective control is still uniformly achieved even if the
  independence assumption is relaxed.%

    BACKGROUND We assessed the efficacy and safety of programmed cell death 1
  (PD-1) inhibition with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced non-small-cell
  lung cancer enrolled in a phase 1 study. We also sought to define and
  validate an expression level of the PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) that is associated
  with the likelihood of clinical benefit. METHODS We assigned 495 patients
  receiving pembrolizumab (at a dose of either 2 mg or 10 mg per kilogram of
  body weight every 3 weeks or 10 mg per kilogram every 2 weeks) to either a
  training group (182 patients) or a validation group (313 patients). We
  assessed PD-L1 expression in tumor samples using immunohistochemical
  analysis, with results reported as the percentage of neoplastic cells with
  staining for membranous PD-L1 (proportion score). Response was assessed every
  9 weeks by central review. RESULTS Common side effects that were attributed
  to pembrolizumab were fatigue, pruritus, and decreased appetite, with no
  clear difference according to dose or schedule. Among all the patients, the
  objective response rate was 19.4{\%}, and the median duration of response was
  12.5 months. The median duration of progression-free survival was 3.7 months,
  and the median duration of overall survival was 12.0 months. PD-L1 expression
  in at least 50{\%} of tumor cells was selected as the cutoff from the
  training group. Among patients with a proportion score of at least 50{\%} in
  the validation group, the response rate was 45.2{\%}. Among all the patients
  with a proportion score of at least 50{\%}, median progression-free survival
  was 6.3 months; median overall survival was not reached. CONCLUSIONS
  Pembrolizumab had an acceptable side-effect profile and showed antitumor
  activity in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. PD-L1
  expression in at least 50{\%} of tumor cells correlated with improved
  efficacy of pembrolizumab. (Funded by Merck; KEYNOTE-001 ClinicalTrials.gov
